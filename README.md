# airbnb-clone-project

## Overview

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program. The goal is to build a simplified clone of the AirBnB web application using core backend and frontend technologies. It will help reinforce our understanding of object-oriented programming, web development, and deployment.

## Project Goals

- Create a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects (users, places, etc.)
- Persist data using JSON serialization
- Implement the backend logic for storing and retrieving data
- Build out basic frontend templates
- Integrate both backend and frontend to simulate the AirBnB experience

## Tech Stack

- **Python** – Core logic and backend
- **Flask** – Web framework (for web interface in later stages)
- **JSON** – Data storage format
- **HTML/CSS** – Frontend structure and design
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and collaboration

## Status
