# airbnb-clone-project

## Overview

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program. The goal is to build a simplified clone of the AirBnB web application using core backend and frontend technologies. It will help reinforce our understanding of object-oriented programming, web development, and deployment.

## Project Goals

- Create a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects (users, places, etc.)
- Persist data using JSON serialization
- Implement the backend logic for storing and retrieving data
- Build out basic frontend templates
- Integrate both backend and frontend to simulate the AirBnB experience

## Tech Stack

- **Python** – Core logic and backend
- **Flask** – Web framework (for web interface in later stages)
- **JSON** – Data storage format
- **HTML/CSS** – Frontend structure and design
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and collaboration

## Status

Project is currently in its setup stage.

## Technology Stack

This project uses a range of technologies to implement the backend, database, API, and future frontend functionality.

###  Python
- **Purpose**: The core programming language used to build the application logic and handle backend operations.

###  Django
- **Purpose**: A high-level Python web framework used to build RESTful APIs, handle routing, and structure backend services.

###  PostgreSQL
- **Purpose**: A powerful, open-source relational database system used for storing and managing structured application data.

###  GraphQL
- **Purpose**: A flexible query language for APIs, allowing the client to request exactly the data it needs — enhancing performance and reducing over-fetching.

###  Pytest
- **Purpose**: A testing framework used to write and run unit tests, ensuring that the application functions correctly and remains stable over time.

###  Git & GitHub
- **Purpose**: Version control tools used to track code changes, collaborate with others, and manage source code in the cloud.

###  Docker (Optional in later stages)
- **Purpose**: Used to containerize the application for consistent development, testing, and deployment environments.

###  RESTful APIs
- **Purpose**: Used to structure how the backend communicates with the frontend or other services, following HTTP standards.
